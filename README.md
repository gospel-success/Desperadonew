# NEW PROJECT: Desperado!
Here is a project I call desperado. A child moral grooming website for an organisation meant to tame young kids (4-12years) who are though by society to be naturally misbehaved.

Despeardo is the online representation for the parent organnisation Despeardo Int'l. They use clear,refined and innovative methods that are unique to groom and train these kids.

The four page site is halfway done. While two pages are are done, I've still got two more to go. The colors were carefully picked to be visually friendly for kids and of course parents/guardins who will be visiting the site for thier ward's sake. The websitealso has a login and register page for existing clients and new intakes respectively.

Upcoming features int the site would include cookies,responsiveness for all screen sizes, and of course some javascript codes to add a bit of intereactiveness and funtionality.

You may go through the project as you wish. Please throw in your thoughts for improvemnet as every idea would be taken seriously. 

Regards,
Success U.I (gospel success).
